        <h1>Comprehensive Solution for Effortless, Unlimited Video Creation!</h1>
        <p>PatchWork gives our users the ability to create mass content. Rather than spending hours creating one TikTok video, PatchWork enables users to generate multiple videos at once. This is an essential feature for businesses & individuals that want to increase their online presence and promote their brand through short-video content.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Since iOS 14.5, our strategy was to diversify creative. PatchWork helps us put together all of these different concepts and helps us fulfill that mandate of diversifying creative. </li>
            <li>It took us like 5 hours to build a batch of creatives. With PatchWork, it could be literally one click, one single click, like not even a minute because you click on it, and you got variations. We now spend only an hour, not 5, because we go the extra mile.</li>
            <li>We launched 20+ PatchWork creatives a week. PatchWork creatives got 30% less CPA. We get a higher success rate on a higher amount of launched ads. We increased ad spend by 60%.</li>
